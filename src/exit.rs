///
/// When a guest virtual CPU executes, various conditions can cause control to be

/// that can occur during VCpu execution.
///
/// # VM Exit Categories
///
/// - **I/O Operations**: MMIO reads/writes, port I/O, system register access
/// - **System Events**: Hypercalls, interrupts, nested page faults
/// - **Power Management**: CPU power state changes, system shutdown
/// - **Multiprocessing**: IPI sending, secondary CPU bring-up
/// - **Error Conditions**: Entry failures, invalid states
///
/// # Compatibility Note
///
/// This enum draws inspiration from [kvm-ioctls](https://github.com/rust-vmm/kvm-ioctls/blob/main/src/ioctls/vcpu.rs)
